This section explains how to install Julia and `Vibration.jl`.

## Install Julia ![](/assets/logo/julia.svg){width=3%}

There exists several ways of installing Julia and managing versions. The recommended way consists in installing `juliaup`, which is a Julia version manager.

- **Windows**

  On Windows, `juliaup` can be installed directly from the [Windows store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJNWW8PVKMN) or from a terminal by typing the following command:
  ```bash
  winget install julia -s msstore
  ```

- **MacOS and Linux**

  On MacOS and Linux, `juliaup` can be installed from a terminal by typing:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
  ```
  or by using software repositories:
  ```bash
  # MacOS
  brew install juliaup

  # Arch-based distributions
  yay -S juliaup
  ```

Once `juliaup` is installed, the latest version of Julia can be installed from a terminal as follows:
```bash
juliaup add release
```
