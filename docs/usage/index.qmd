```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
using UFFFiles
```

At the moment, `UFFFiles.jl` only implements reading functionalities through the function `readuff`. Future versions will include additional functionalities for writing UFF data in a given format.

## Reading UFF Files

```julia
using UFFFiles

data = readuff("path/to/your/file.uff")
```

::: {.api}
```{julia}
#| echo: false
@doc readuff
```
:::

Because `readuff` returns a vector of datasets, you can interact with a given dataset as usually done in Julia. A dataset is a Julia composite type (i.e., a struct), having its own fields, corresponding to the UFF dataset type.

As an example, let's say that you have read a UFF file containing multiple datasets. You can access each dataset by indexing the returned vector and interacting with it through its fields.
```julia
# Access to the first dataset extracted
# Suppose that the first dataset is of type Dataset15
d15 = data[1]

# Access to the list of node coordinates
node_coords = d15.coords
```
